## Objectives 

QueerHire is founded on the following principles:

### 🦄 Helping the Youth

The website focuses on providing jobs, internships, and scholarships to young LGBTQ+ people to help them overcome the challenges they face and build a strong foundation for their future.

### 🦄 LGBTQ+ hiring platform

There is no exclusive hiring platform for LGBTQ+ people, despite the challenges they face in their careers. This is especially true for young LGBTQ+ people, who may fear society and struggle to find job opportunities.

### 🦄 Workplace diversity

Workplace diversity is important for the overall growth and success of organizations, but companies often find it difficult to find and hire LGBTQ+ people.

### 🦄 Social inclusion

Society often ignores or discriminates against LGBTQ+ people. It is time to address these issues and create a more inclusive society.

## Technologies 

QueerHire utilizes the following technologies:

👩‍💻 **Flutter**: The web application is developed using Flutter to ensure a responsive and user-friendly interface.

👩‍💻 **Firebase**: Firebase serves as the backend and deployment platform, providing authentication, data storage, and hosting capabilities for the web application.
